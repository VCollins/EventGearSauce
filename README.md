# EventGearSauce
An example deployment of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [React](https://react.dev) for an event equipment rental company.

The development approach followed uses a Django-based server for the backend (ORM and API) and a ReactJS server for the frontend, to be able to use
the flexibility that React offers with components.

The Django REST framework is used to create an API in the backend project that the frontend consumes to provide requested information from the SQLite3 database. The model currently only consists of one item, but this will expand as development progresses.

This website example is a work in progress.
