# EventGearSauce
An example deployment of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for an event equipment rental company.

The development approach followed will use site-wide static files (CSS, JS & images) and HTML templates. This is done so that all projects within the main project folder have access to these assets.

Thanks to [William S. Vincent](https://github.com/wsvincent) for his book series on Django development.
