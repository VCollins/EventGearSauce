# EventGearSauce
An example deployment of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for an event equipment rental company.

The development approach followed will use site-wide static files (CSS, JS & images) and HTML templates. This is done so that all projects within the main project folder have access to these assets.

So far, basic CRUD pages exist for creating, viewing, updating and deleting sound equipment on the site. User authentication and credentials will eventually be implemented to 
control access to site actions.
